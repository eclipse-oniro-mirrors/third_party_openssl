    # no-shared will disable building shared libcrypto and libssl libraries.
    # But the legacy provider would still be built as a shared module.
    # So you would need the legacy shared module present on the installed
    # system and the paths would have to be correct.
    # You can use no-module to make the legacy provider built-in.

    # Is there a way to build a static version of openssl3, including the "legacy" OSSL_PROVIDER?

    # Configure with no-shared no-module. The legacy provider is then part of libcrypto.a.
    # You still need to "load" it via OSSL_PROVIDER_load() - but no .so file is required in that case.
